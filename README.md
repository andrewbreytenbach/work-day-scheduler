# Work-Day-Scheduler

## About The Project

The goal of this project was to create an interactive work day scheduler that allows users to input events and then save htem for later use. It also is visually accesible, telling users what time it is based on the color of the time blocks. 

### Built With

* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Getting Started

In order to acess this website, just visit the following webpage: [https://github.com/andrewbreytenbach/work-day-scheduler](https://github.com/andrewbreytenbach/work-day-scheduler)

To get a local copy up and running, simply view the index.html file, stle.css, or the script.js file and see how you can play around, copy, and edit the file for personal usage. You can also change the color of the time blocks, the font, or even the way the time is displayed for individual use.

## Usage

Once the user first acceses the website, the following image is what they will find: 

![Start Page](/images/start-page.png "Start Page")

This is the start page for the work day scheduler. Here the user sees that the day and time is displayed on the top of the page in the header. Additionally, the user will also know what time it is by the color of the blocks- red for the current hour, gray for the previous hours, and green for future hours.

In order to add an event, the user simply needs to begin typing in any time block and then hit the blue save button. This will save the text to local storage, and even if the page is refreshed or the browser is closed, the event is still stored and the text will be displayed until the user manually deletes it.

![First Event](/images/first-event.png "First Event")

Depending on the time of day, the user will see one, two, or three colors, as shown below:

![Interactive Time](/images/interactive-time.png "Interactive Time")

Again, red is for the current hour, green is for future hours, and gray is for past hours. This gives the user a quick visual to know where in the work day scheduler they are and what events still need to take place.
